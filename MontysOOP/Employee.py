# --- Test Area ---
# It's a good practice to have a small test block like this.
# The `if __name__ == "__main__":` part means this code will only run
# when you execute this file directly (e.g., `python Employee.py`),
# not when it's imported into another file.

    emp1 = Employee("Meri", "Kasprak", "8939", 222)
